	<h1>Aviakubo, the Web Dev</h1>
	<p>My name is David Yakubov and I'll bet you're probably wondering what an 'Aviakubo' is. I'll tell you! It is actually a nickname that consists of my first and last name without the first and last letters. I began messing around in HTML when MySpace was relevant; always embedding videos on my page, changing the cursor, and all sorts of neat stuff. Here I am many years later and exploring web development as a potential career choice. </p>
